## Installations

User should have Python3 and Jupyter Notebook installed into their system.

User should also have the following packages installed:
* sklearn
* pandas
* numpy
* matplotlib

## Dataset

The dataset is provided in a .csv file. It can also be retrieved from the following link: https://github.com/ArinB/CA05-B-Logistic-Regression/raw/master/cvd_data.csv

The dataset contains records of real heart patients collected from a 15 year heart study cohort. It has 16 patient features. Note that none of the features include any Blood Test information.

## Instructions

User can open CA05_A.ipynb through jupyter notebook or the Google Colab environment. Run all cells as needed.

## Usage

There are 4 sections contained in the CA05_A.ipynb notebook file:
* Dataset\
  Reading and cleaning data to prepare for analysis
* Part 1: Logistic Regression\
  Build a binary classifier model to predict the CVD Risk (Yes/No, or 1/0) using a Logistic Regression Model with the best performance possible.
* Part 2: Feature Importance\
  Display the Feature Importance of all the features sorted in the order of decreasing influence on the CVD Risk.
* Part 3: Evaluate Performance\
  Evaluate the performance of your model (including ROC Curve), explain the performance and draw a meaningful conclusion.
